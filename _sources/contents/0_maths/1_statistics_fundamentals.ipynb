    "# Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is the mathematical foundation that turns raw data into useful insights. It’s often called the \"grammar of machine learning\" because it provides the tools to understand data, build models, and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Statistics in ML/DL\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is vital in ML and DL for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding Data**: It helps uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships in data.\n",
    "- **Preprocessing Data**: It identifies missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies to clean data for modeling.\n",
    "- **Evaluating Models**: It provides metrics like accuracy or mean squared error to measure performance.\n",
    "- **Making Predictions**: It allows us to draw conclusions from limited data.\n",
    "- **Quantifying Uncertainty**: It estimates probabilities and confidence levels for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Statistics Matters in ML/DL\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics supports key tasks in ML and DL, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Selection**: Picking the most important variables for accurate predictions.\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**: Checking how data is spread (e.g., normal, skewed) to improve models.\n",
    "- **Performance Metrics**: Measuring success with tools like confusion matrices or R-squared.\n",
    "- **Preventing Errors**: Avoiding issues like bias or overfitting so models work well on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics splits into two main areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes and describes data.\n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics**: Makes predictions or conclusions about a larger group based on a smaller one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics organizes and summarizes data to show its main features. It’s widely used in **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** before building ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "To describe key aspects of a dataset, like its average or spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Measures\n",
    "- **Central Tendency** (where the data centers):\n",
    "  - **Mean (μ)**: The average value.\n",
    "  - **Median**: The middle value when data is sorted.\n",
    "  - **Mode**: The value that appears most often.\n",
    "- **Dispersion** (how spread out the data is):\n",
    "  - **Variance (σ²)**: Measures how much data varies from the mean.\n",
    "  - **Standard Deviation (σ)**: Square root of variance, showing spread in original units.\n",
    "  - **Range**: Maximum value minus minimum value.\n",
    "  - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Spread of the middle 50% of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ML Example\n",
    "Before training models, data is often **standardized** (adjusted to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1) or **normalized** (scaled to a range like 0 to 1). This ensures all features contribute equally."

    "- Powers **Naive Bayes classifiers**, often used for text classification (e.g., spam filters).\n",

    "- **High Bias**: Model is too simple (underfitting).\n",
    "- **High Variance**: Model is too complex (overfitting).\n",
    "- **Fix**: Techniques like regularization (e.g., L1/L2) balance this tradeoff.\n",
