    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental principle explaining why averages (or sums) of data tend to follow a **normal (bell-shaped) distribution**, even if the original data isn't normally distributed. This theorem is crucial in ML for reliable inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Core Principles of CLT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For any population with a mean **μ** and standard deviation **σ**, the sampling distribution of the sample means will:  \n",
    "- Approach a normal distribution as the sample size (n) increases (typically n ≥ 30).  \n",
    "- Have a mean equal to the population mean (μ).  \n",
    "- Have a standard error equal to σ/√n.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Size**: Generally, n ≥ 30 is sufficient, but for highly skewed data, larger samples may be needed.  \n",
    "- **Finite Variance**: The population must have a finite variance (most real-world data satisfies this).  \n",
    "- **Random Sampling**: Samples must be randomly selected and representative of the population.  \n",
    "- **Independence**: Observations should be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-world data is often messy** (e.g., incomes, test scores, website clicks). The CLT allows us to treat averages of this data as normally distributed, even if the raw data isn't.  \n",
    "- This is why statistical methods like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals work reliably in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "Imagine rolling a die 50 times and calculating the average roll. Repeat this process many times. While individual rolls are equally likely to be 1–6 (uniform distribution), the averages of those 50-roll samples will cluster around 3.5 (the true average) in a bell-shaped curve. The larger the sample size, the tighter the cluster around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 2. Why CLT Matters in AI/ML\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLT underpins many statistical methods used in ML, enabling reliable inference and model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidence Intervals**: The CLT justifies confidence intervals for model performance metrics, helping us understand prediction reliability.  \n",
    "- **Model Assumptions**: Many algorithms, like Linear Regression, assume residuals (errors) are normally distributed, which is often reasonable due to the CLT.\n",

    "1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** \"The coin is normal (50/50 chance)\"\n",

    "## Practical Implementation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to test a hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Hypotheses**  \n",
    "   - H₀: No effect (e.g., \"Model accuracy = 80%\")  \n",
    "   - H₁: Effect exists (e.g., \"Accuracy > 80%\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pick a Test**  \n",
    "   - Small sample? Use T-test.  \n",
    "   - Categories? Use Chi-Square.  \n",
    "   - Many groups? Use ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose α**  \n",
    "   - Typically 0.05 (5% risk of error).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Statistic**  \n",
    "   - Z-score: \\( Z = \\frac{\\text{sample mean} - \\text{population mean}}{\\text{std dev} / \\sqrt{n}} \\)  \n",
    "   - T-score: Similar, but uses sample standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decide**  \n",
    "   - p < α: Reject H₀ (evidence supports H₁).  \n",
    "   - p ≥ α: Stick with H₀ (not enough evidence).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Example: Z-Test\n",
