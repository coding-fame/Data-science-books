# Git Essentials

Git is a tool that helps developers manage code, track changes, and work together on projects. It’s especially valuable in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), where you deal with experiments, models, and teamwork. This guide explains Git simply and clearly.

## What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system that:
- Keeps a record of all changes to your code.
- Lets multiple people work on the same project without issues.
- Saves a history so you can undo mistakes.
- Supports working on different tasks at the same time using branches.

## Why Use Git in ML and DL?

Git is great for ML and DL because it:
- **Tracks experiments**: Save versions of your models or data processing code.
- **Supports teamwork**: Share your work with others easily.
- **Fixes mistakes**: Go back to a working version if your code breaks.
- **Organizes projects**: Manage code, datasets, and models in one place.

For example, you might use one branch to tweak a neural network and another to test a new dataset, then combine them later.

## Key Features of Git

- **Version Control**: Tracks file changes and lets you revert to older versions.
- **Distributed System**: Everyone gets a full copy of the project, so it’s fast and reliable.
- **Branching and Merging**: Work on separate tasks and blend them into the main project.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can edit the same project without overwriting each other.
- **Efficiency**: Works quickly, even with big projects.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Repository (Repo)
A repo is where your code and its history live.
- **Local Repository**: On your computer.
- **Remote Repository**: On a server like GitHub or GitLab.

**In ML/DL**: A repo might hold your data scripts, model code, and training files.

### 2. Staging Area
A holding spot where you prepare changes before saving them.

### 3. Commit
A saved snapshot of your code with a message about what’s new.

**In ML/DL**: You might commit after adding a new layer to your model.

### 4. Branch
A separate path for developing code (e.g., `main`, `new-feature`).

**In ML/DL**: Create a branch to test a new algorithm, like a different optimizer.

### 5. Merge
Combines changes from one branch into another.

### 6. Pull
Gets updates from a remote repo and adds them to your local copy.

### 7. Push
Sends your local changes to a remote repo.

## Basic Git Commands

Here are the key commands, explained simply with ML/DL examples.

### File and Directory Commands
```sh
ls                  # List files in your folder
ls -a               # Show all files, even hidden ones like .git
rm -rf .git         # Delete the .git folder to start fresh
cd ..               # Move up one folder level
clear               # Clear your terminal
```

### Starting a Git Repo
```sh
git init            # Start a new Git repo in your folder
git status          # See what’s changed or ready to save
git add .           # Prepare all changes for saving
git commit -m "Added data loader" # Save changes with a message
```

**In ML/DL**: Use `git commit -m "Added data loader"` after writing code to load a dataset.

### Setting Up Your Identity
```sh
git config --global user.email "you@example.com" # Set your email
git config --global user.name "Your Name"        # Set your name
git config --list                                # Check your settings
```

### Working with Branches
```sh
git branch                  # List all branches
git branch test-model       # Make a new branch
git branch -d test-model    # Delete a branch
git checkout test-model     # Switch to a branch
git merge test-model        # Combine a branch into the current one
```

**In ML/DL**: Create `git branch test-model` to try a new ML model, then merge it if it works.

### Viewing History
```sh
git log               # See past commits
git show <commit_hash> # Look at details of one commit
```
*Press `q` to exit the log.*

### Undoing Changes
```sh
git restore script.py # Undo changes to one file
git restore .         # Undo all recent changes
git rm --cached script.py # Remove a file from staging
git reset .           # Clear the staging area
```

### Saving Work Temporarily
```sh
git stash                # Save changes without committing
git stash list           # See saved changes
git stash apply stash@{0} # Use the latest saved changes
git stash clear          # Delete all saved changes
```

**In ML/DL**: Use `git stash` to pause tweaking a model and switch to fixing a bug.

### Collaborating with Others
```sh
git push origin main     # Send your work to the remote repo
git push --all origin    # Send all branches
git pull                 # Get updates from the remote repo
```

**In ML/DL**: After improving a training script, `git push` shares it with your team.

## Example Workflow in ML

Here’s how you might use Git for an ML project:

1. **Start a repo**:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```

2. **Add your code**:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added initial ML code"
   ```

3. **Create a branch** for a new experiment (e.g., a CNN model):
   ```sh
   git branch try-cnn
   git checkout try-cnn
   ```

4. **Save your changes**:
   ```sh
   git add model.py
   git commit -m "Added CNN model"
   ```

5. **Go back to the main branch**:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   ```

6. **Merge your experiment**:
   ```sh
   git merge try-cnn
   ```

7. **Check your progress**:
   ```sh
   git log
   ```
