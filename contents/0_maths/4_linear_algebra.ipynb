    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "Linear algebra focuses on three main objects:\n",
    "- **Vectors**: Ordered lists of numbers representing data points or directions.\n",
    "  - *Example*: `[2, 3]` can represent a point in 2D space or features like [height, weight].\n",
    "- **Matrices**: Rectangular arrays that organize data or perform transformations.\n",
    "  - *Example*: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` can represent a dataset or a linear transformation.\n",
    "- **Tensors**: Multi-dimensional arrays generalizing vectors and matrices, crucial in DL for handling complex data like images.\n",
    "  - *Example*: A 3D tensor might represent an image with height, width, and color channels.\n",

    "\n",
    "Linear transformations are essential tools in **machine learning (ML)**, **deep learning (DL)**, **computer vision**, and **3D graphics**. They allow us to modify data, such as images or feature vectors, while preserving linearity. This makes them useful for tasks like scaling, rotation, shearing, and reflection, which are critical in areas like image augmentation, feature engineering, and model optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Linear Transformations?\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear transformation is a function that maps vectors from one space to another while preserving two key properties: **addition** and **scalar multiplication**. In simpler terms, it transforms data using matrix multiplication, keeping the operations linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties\n",
    "For a transformation \\( T \\), it must satisfy:\n",
    "- \\( T(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}) = T(\\mathbf{u}) + T(\\mathbf{v}) \\) (preserves addition)\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, \\( \\mathbf{u} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) are vectors, and \\( k \\) is a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "In practice, linear transformations are represented by matrices. For a vector \\( \\mathbf{v} \\), the transformed vector is:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "T(\\mathbf{v}) = A \\mathbf{v}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "where \\( A \\) is the transformation matrix.\n",
