# Input/Output and Flow Control

---

## 9. Input and Output in Python

### What is Input and Output?
- **Input**: Data provided to the program, such as user entries or datasets for ML models.
- **Output**: Results generated by the program, like predictions or accuracy scores.

Understanding input and output is essential in ML for feeding data into models and displaying results.

---

### Hard Coding vs. Dynamic Input

#### Hard Coding
- Values are directly assigned in the code (e.g., setting `age = 16`).
- Useful for testing but not flexible for real-world ML applications where data changes.

**Example:**
```python
age = 16  # Hard-coded value
print("Age is:", age)
```

#### Dynamic Input
- Values are entered by the user during runtime.
- Essential for ML to handle real-time data, like user inputs for predictions.

**Example:**
```python
# Dynamic input for ML model testing
# age = input("Please enter the age: ")
print("Entered age is:", age)
```

---

### The `input()` Function
- `input(p)` is a built-in Python function that accepts keyboard input.
- It returns the input as a **string** type, even if the user enters a number.
- You can convert the string to other types (e.g., `int` or `float`) for ML calculations.

**Example: Taking a Name as Input**
```python
# Taking user input for ML data preprocessing
name = input("Enter the name: ")
print("You entered name as:", name)
```

**Example: Checking the Type of Input**
```python
# Checking input type for ML data validation
value = input("Enter the value: ")
print("Entered value as:", value)
print("Type is:", type(value))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

**ML Tip:**
- Always validate input types to ensure compatibility with ML models (e.g., numerical inputs for regression).

---

### Type Conversion
Python allows converting data types to match your needs. This is crucial in ML for preparing data.

#### Common Type Conversion Functions
| **Function**     | **Purpose**                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `int(p)`         | Converts to integer (e.g., for epochs in training). |
| `float(p)`       | Converts to float (e.g., for model accuracy).       |
| `str(p)`         | Converts to string (e.g., for text preprocessing).  |
| `bool(p)`        | Converts to Boolean (e.g., for binary classification). |
| `list(p)`        | Converts to list (e.g., for datasets).              |
| `tuple(p)`       | Converts to tuple (e.g., for immutable data).       |
| `set(p)`         | Converts to set (e.g., for unique labels).          |
| `dict(p)`        | Converts to dictionary (e.g., for feature mapping). |

#### Examples
1. **String to Integer (for ML epochs):**
   ```python
   epochs = "10"
   epochs_int = int(epochs)
   print("Converted value:", epochs_int)  # Output: 10
   ```

2. **String to Float (for ML predictions):**
   ```python
   accuracy = "0.85"
   accuracy_float = float(accuracy)
   print("Converted value:", accuracy_float)  # Output: 0.85
   ```

3. **Float to Integer (for ML batch size):**
   ```python
   batch_size = 32.75
   batch_int = int(batch_size)
   print("Converted value:", batch_int)  # Output: 32
   ```

**ML Tip:**
- Use `float` for continuous data (e.g., weights) and `int` for discrete data (e.g., epochs).

## 10. Flow Control in Python

### What is Flow Control?
Flow control determines the order in which statements in a program are executed. This is critical in ML for decision-making and iterating over data.

There are three main execution styles:
1. **Sequential Execution**: Runs code line by line.
2. **Conditional Execution**: Executes code based on conditions.
3. **Looping Execution**: Repeats code based on conditions.

---

### Types of Execution

#### 1. Sequential Execution
- Code runs from top to bottom.
- Suitable for simple ML tasks, like printing model results.

**Example:**
```python
print("Training started")
print("Model accuracy: 0.92")
print("Training completed")
```

#### 2. Conditional Execution
- Allows decisions based on conditions.
- Essential for ML tasks like checking model performance.

**Conditional Statements:**
- `if`
- `if-else`
- `if-elif-else`
- `if-elif-elif-else`

#### 3. Looping Execution
- Repeats code multiple times.
- Useful in ML for iterating over datasets or training epochs.

**Loop Types:**
- `for` loop
- `while` loop

---

### Keywords in Flow Control
| **Keyword**  | **Purpose**                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `break`      | Exits the loop early (e.g., stop training). |
| `continue`   | Skips the current iteration (e.g., skip invalid data). |
| `pass`       | Placeholder for future code (e.g., empty ML function). |

---

### Indentation in Python
- **Indentation** defines blocks of code in Python.
- Use **4 spaces** as the standard (or any consistent number).
- Incorrect indentation causes an `IndentationError`.

**Example Error:**
```python
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

**ML Tip:**
- Proper indentation ensures ML code runs correctly, especially in loops and conditionals.

---

### Conditional Statements

#### 1. `if` Statement
- Executes code if a condition is **True**.
- Useful in ML for checking thresholds (e.g., accuracy > 0.9).

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition:
    # Block of code
```

**Example:**
```python
accuracy = 0.95
if accuracy > 0.9:
    print("Model performs well!")
```

#### 2. `if-else` Statement
- Executes one block if **True**, another if **False**.
- Useful in ML for binary decisions (e.g., pass/fail).

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition:
    # Block of code if True
else:
    # Block of code if False
```

**Example:**
```python
accuracy = 0.85
if accuracy > 0.9:
    print("Model performs well!")
else:
    print("Model needs improvement.")
```

#### 3. `if-elif-else` Statement
- **`if`, `elif`, and `else` are keywords in Python**.
- The `if` and `elif`statement contains an **expression/condition/value**.
- **Colon (`:`) is mandatory**, otherwise, **SyntaxError** occurs.
- Checks multiple conditions in sequence.
- Executes the first **True** condition, skips others.
- If all conditions are **False**, runs the `else` block.
- Useful in ML for multi-class classification.

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition1:
    # Block of code for condition1
elif condition2:
    # Block of code for condition2
else:
    # Block of code if no condition is True
```

**Example:**
```python
# ML example: Classify model performance
accuracy = float(input("Enter model accuracy (0-1): "))
if accuracy >= 0.9:
    print("Excellent model!")
elif accuracy >= 0.8:
    print("Good model.")
elif accuracy >= 0.7:
    print("Fair model.")
else:
    print("Model needs retraining.")
```

**Notes:**
- `if`, `elif`, and `else` are keywords.
- Conditions must end with a colon (`:`), or a `SyntaxError` occurs.

---

### Looping Statements

- If we want to **execute a group of statements multiple times**, we use **looping**.

#### 1. `for` Loop
- Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string).
- Essential in ML for processing datasets or epochs.

**Syntax:**
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Block of code
```

**Example: Iterate Over ML Dataset**
```python
# Example: Process dataset
data = [1.2, 2.5, 3.7, 4.1]
for value in data:
    print("Data point:", value)
```

#### 2. `while` Loop
- Repeats code while a condition is **True**.
- Useful in ML for training loops or stopping criteria.

**Syntax:**
```python
while condition:
    # Block of code
```

**Example: ML Training Loop**
```python
epoch = 1
max_epochs = 5
while epoch <= max_epochs:
    print("Training epoch:", epoch)
    epoch += 1
```

---

### Control Flow Keywords

#### `break`
- Exits the loop early.
- Useful in ML for early stopping (e.g., stop if loss is low).

**Example:**
```python
# Early stopping in ML training
epoch = 1
while epoch <= 10:
    loss = 0.1 / epoch  # Simulated loss
    print("Epoch:", epoch, "Loss:", loss)
    if loss < 0.05:
        print("Loss is low. Stopping training.")
        break
    epoch += 1
```

#### `continue`
- Skips the current iteration, continues with the next.
- Useful in ML for skipping invalid data.

**Example:**
```python
# Skip invalid ML data
data = [10, -1, 20, -5, 30]  # -1 and -5 are invalid
for value in data:
    if value < 0:
        print("Skipping invalid data:", value)
        continue
    print("Processing data:", value)
```

#### `pass`
- Placeholder for future code (does nothing).
- Useful in ML for planning functions or conditional blocks.

**Example:**
```python
# Placeholder for ML model evaluation
def evaluate_model():
    pass  # To be implemented later
evaluate_model()
```

---

## Summary
- **Input/Output**: Use `input()` for dynamic data and type conversion for ML compatibility.
- **Flow Control**: Use conditionals (`if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`) for decisions and loops (`for`, `while`) for repetition.
- **Keywords**: Use `break`, `continue`, and `pass` for advanced flow control.
- **ML Relevance**: These concepts are essential for preprocessing data, training models, and evaluating performance.
