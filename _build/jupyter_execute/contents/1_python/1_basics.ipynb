    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python?\n",
    "- **Python** is a general purpose and high-level programming language.\n",
    "- **General purpose** means that many companies use Python to develop, test, and deploy software applications.\n",
    "- **High-level programming** means it’s human-readable and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python** is a popular, high-level programming language that’s easy to read and write.\n",
    "- **High-level** means it’s designed for humans to understand, not just machines.\n",
    "- It’s widely used in many fields, especially Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Python for Machine Learning?\n",
    "Python is perfect for ML because:\n",
    "- It’s simple to learn and use.\n",
    "- It has powerful libraries like **NumPy** (for math), **Pandas** (for data handling), **Scikit-learn** (for ML models), and **TensorFlow** (for deep learning).\n",
    "- These tools help you process data, build models, and train them efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Programming Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Python programming, we can develop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standalone Applications:**  \n",
    "   Applications that need to be installed on each machine to work.\n",
    "2. **Web Applications:**  \n",
    "   Applications that follow a client-server architecture.\n",
    "3. **Database Applications:**  \n",
    "   Applications that perform CRUD (create, update, retrieve, and delete) operations in a database.\n",
    "4. **Big Data Applications:**  \n",
    "   Applications that can process large datasets (e.g., using PySpark).\n",
    "5. **Machine Learning:**  \n",
    "   Applications that enable computers to learn automatically from past data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### History of Python\n",
    "- Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.\n",
    "- It’s **open-source**, meaning it’s free to use and download from [www.python.org](https://www.python.org).\n",
    "- Supports **functional programming** (using functions) and **object-oriented programming** (using classes), which are great for organizing ML projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Python Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords are special words in Python with specific meanings. You can’t use them as variable names. They’re important for writing ML code correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a table of common Python keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Category**         | **Keywords**                           |\n",
    "|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Control Flow**     | `if`, `else`, `elif`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `pass` |\n",
    "| **Functions**        | `def`, `lambda`, `return`, `yield`    |\n",
    "| **Classes**          | `class`, `with`                       |\n",
    "| **Modules**          | `import`, `from`                      |\n",
    "| **Logic**            | `and`, `or`, `not`                    |\n",
    "| **Constants**        | `True`, `False`, `None`               |\n",
    "| **Exceptions**       | `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`   |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Keywords are lowercase, except `True`, `False`, and `None`.\n",
    "- Example in ML: Use `if` and `else` to check model accuracy during training.\n",

    "### Execution Steps\n",
    "1. **Source Code**: Your Python file (e.g., `model.py`).\n",

    "\n",

    "### What Are Identifiers?\n",
    "Identifiers are names for things like variables, functions, or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "- Use letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`).\n",
    "- Don’t start with a number. `SyntaxError`\n",
    "- They’re case-sensitive (e.g., `Data` ≠ `data`). `NameError`\n",
    "- Don’t use keywords (e.g., `if`). `SyntaxError`\n",
    "- Don't use spaces (e.g. `a b`). `SyntaxError`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices for ML:**\n",
    "- **Variables**: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `training_data`).\n",
    "- **Functions**: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `predict_output`).\n",
    "- **Classes**: Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `NeuralNetwork`).\n",
    "- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `LEARNING_RATE`).\n",
