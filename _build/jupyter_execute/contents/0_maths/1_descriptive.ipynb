    "  - Test scores: 80, 90, 100\n",
    "  - Mean = (80 + 90 + 100) ÷ 3 = 90\n",
    "- **Best Use Case**: When all values are equally important, such as:\n",
    "  - Average temperature\n",
    "  - Average student grades\n",
    "- **ML/DL Application**:\n",
    "  - Used in loss functions like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, which measures how close a model's predictions are to the actual values by averaging the squared differences.\n",

    "## What is Variability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variability, or spread, measures how scattered data points are in a dataset. It tells you if the data clusters around the center (like the mean) or spreads out widely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: To measure how spread out the data is, which helps in understanding datasets and making decisions in ML and DL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It’s Important in ML/DL**:\n",
    "- Spots outliers that can confuse models.\n",
    "- Helps scale features so algorithms like neural networks work better.\n",
    "- Guides data preprocessing and model choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 1. Range\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: The difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.\n",

    "  - Maximum: 400, Minimum: 200  \n",
    "  - Range: `400 - 200 = 200` thousand dollars\n",
    "- **Best Use**: A fast way to see the total spread of data.\n",
    "- **ML/DL Use**:  \n",
    "  - Checks for extreme values in features (e.g., very high prices).  \n",
    "  - Identifies outliers that might affect model training.\n",
    "- **Limitation**: Outliers can make the range misleading. For example, adding 1000 would change the range to 800, hiding the true spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point**: Range is quick but doesn’t show how data is distributed between the extremes.\n",

    "  `Variance = Σ(x_i - μ)² / n`  \n",

    "  - Variance: `(10000 + 2500 + 0 + 2500 + 10000) / 5 = 5000` thousand dollars²\n",

    "- **Limitation**: Squared units (e.g., thousand dollars²) make it hard to interpret directly.\n",

    "- **Best Use**: When you need a clear, interpretable measure of spread.\n",
    "- **ML/DL Use**:  \n",
    "  - **Feature Scaling**: Standardizes features (mean = 0, SD = 1) for algorithms like gradient descent.  \n",
    "  - **Model Evaluation**: Shows how much predictions vary.\n",
    "- **Limitation**: Sensitive to outliers, like variance.\n",

    "## What is an Outlier?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **outlier** is a data point that is very different from the rest of the dataset. It’s like the odd one out—much larger or smaller than the other values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "An outlier is an unusual observation that doesn’t fit the general pattern of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- Outliers have extreme values in the **outcome** (the variable we predict, often called Y).\n",
    "- They can affect key numbers like:\n",
    "  - **Mean** (average): Outliers pull it up or down.\n",
    "  - **Variance** (spread): Outliers make the data seem more scattered.\n",
    "- They can be much higher or lower than typical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Outliers Matter in ML\n",
    "Outliers can cause trouble in ML models:\n",
    "- **Lower accuracy**: They add **noise** or **bias**, leading to wrong predictions.\n",
    "- **Skewed metrics**: They mess up measures like **mean squared error (MSE)**, which shows how well the model performs.\n",
    "- **Training problems**: They can slow down or confuse training, especially in models sensitive to extremes, like linear regression or DL networks with small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Find Outliers\n",
    "Spotting outliers is a key step in preparing data. Here are common ways:\n",
    "- **Visual Tools**:\n",
    "  - **Boxplots**: Show outliers as points outside the \"whiskers.\"\n",
    "  - **Scatter plots**: Highlight points far from the main group.\n",
    "  - **Histograms**: Show extreme values that don’t fit the pattern.\n",
    "- **Statistical Methods**:\n",
    "  - **Z-score**: If a point is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean, it’s likely an outlier.\n",
    "  - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Points outside 1.5 times the IQR are outliers.\n",
    "- **ML Tools**:\n",
    "  - **Isolation Forest**: An algorithm that identifies outliers by isolating them in decision trees.\n",
    "  - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**: Marks sparse points as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Finding an Outlier with a Boxplot\n",
    "Let’s look at exam scores: 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 1000. The score 1000 looks out of place."

    "## Handling Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "To make ML models work better, we need to deal with outliers. Here are three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Remove Outliers\n",
    "- If they’re **errors** (e.g., a typo), take them out.\n",
    "- Example: If a height is listed as 20 feet, it’s likely a mistake and should be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Transform the Data\n",
    "- **Log Transformation**: Shrinks big values to lessen their impact.\n",
    "  - Example: If salaries range from $10,000 to $1,000,000, applying `log(salary)` makes extreme values less dominant.\n",
    "- **Normalization**: Scales all values (e.g., 0 to 1) to reduce outlier effects.\n",
    "  - Example: Use Python’s `MinMaxScaler` for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use Robust Models\n",
    "- **Tree-based models**: Like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting, which handle outliers better than linear models.\n",
    "- **Median-based methods**: Use measures like median absolute deviation (MAD) or IQR, which are less affected by outliers compared to mean-based methods.\n",

    "4. **Third Quartile (Q3)**: The value where 75% of the data falls below (75th percentile).\n",
    "5. **Maximum**: The largest value in the dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The **normal distribution**, also called the Gaussian distribution, is a bell-shaped curve that shows how data points are spread around the mean (average). It’s a key concept in ML because many algorithms rely on its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties \n",
    "- **Symmetry**: The curve is the same on both sides of the mean.\n",
    "- **Mean, Median, Mode**: These are all equal and sit at the center.\n",
    "- **Most Data Near the Mean**: Values cluster around the average, with fewer points further away.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 68-95-99.7 Rule (Empirical Rule)\n",
    "- About **68%** of data is within **1 standard deviation (σ)** of the mean.\n",
    "- About **95%** is within **2σ**.\n",
    "- About **99.7%** is within **3σ**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters in ML\n",
    "- **Linear Regression**: Assumes errors (differences between predicted and actual values) are normally distributed.\n",
    "- **Deep Learning**: Neural network weights are often set initially using values from a normal distribution.\n",
    "- **Statistics**: Helps calculate probabilities and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard normal distribution** is a simplified version of the normal distribution with:\n",
    "- **Mean (μ) = 0**\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation (σ) = 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s used to standardize data, making it easier to compare values from different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Z-Scores\n",
    "A **z-score** shows how far a data point is from the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
