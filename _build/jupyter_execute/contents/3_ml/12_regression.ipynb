    "Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm used in **supervised learning** for predicting continuous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Regression\n",
    "**Regression analysis** is used to understand the relationship between two variables. It is widely used in data science and machine learning for **predictive modeling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What Is Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Regression** is a fundamental machine learning technique used to model the relationship between **dependent** and **independent** variables. It helps in predicting outcomes based on input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression assumes that the relationship between variables can be represented by a straight line (or a flat surface in higher dimensions). It’s widely used because it’s simple, effective, and provides a strong foundation for more advanced ML techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Linear Regression\n",
    "There are two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "- Uses **one independent variable** (X) to predict **one dependent variable** (Y).\n",
    "- The goal is to draw a **straight line** that best fits the data, showing how changes in the independent variable affect the dependent variable.\n",
    "- Example: Predicting house price based on area.\n",
    "- Formula:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  y = m * X + b\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Where:  \n",
    "  - **y** = Dependent variable (Predicted output)  \n",
    "  - **X** = Independent variable (Input feature)  \n",
    "  - **m** = Slope (Coefficient)  \n",
    "  - **b** = Intercept (Constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula creates a straight line, where **m** controls the tilt and **b** shifts the line up or down.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "- Uses **two or more independent variables** (X₁, X₂, … Xₙ) to predict **one dependent variable** (Y).\n",
    "- The goal is to find the coefficients that define the best-fitting **hyperplane**, minimizing the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "- Example: Predicting house price based on **area, location, and number of bedrooms**.\n",
    "- Formula:  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  y = m₁*X₁ + m₂*X₂ + .... + mₙ*Xₙ + b\n",
    "  ```  \n",
    "  Where:\n",
    "  - **Y** = Predicted price\n",
    "  - **X₁, X₂, X₃** = Independent variables (Area, Bedrooms, Age)\n",
    "  - **m₁, m₂, m₃** = Coefficients (Slope values) (the effect of each x on y)\n",
    "  - **b** = Intercept (Bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula creates a straight line, where **m** controls the tilt and **b** shifts the line up or down.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Coefficients\n",
    "- **Slope (m)**: Measures the impact of the independent variable. For example, if m = 135.79, the price increases by $135.79 for each square foot.\n",
    "- **Intercept (b)**: The starting point of the line when x = 0.\n",
    "- The **intercept (b)** and **coefficients (M₁, M₂, M₃)** define the linear equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Assumptions\n",
    "Simple linear regression works best when:\n",
    "- The relationship between x and y is **linear** (a straight line fits).\n",
    "- Data points are **independent** (one doesn’t affect another) that is uncorrelated (No Multicollinearity).\n",
    "- Errors (differences between actual and predicted values) have **constant variance** (Homoscedasticity) and are **normally distributed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "To check how good the model is:\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of squared differences between actual and predicted values. Lower is better.\n",
    "- **R-squared (R²)**: Shows how much of the data’s variation the model explains (0 to 1, closer to 1 is better).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Best Fit line\n",
    "- The \"best-fitting\" line is the one that gets as close as possible to all data points. \n",
    "- In ML, this is done by minimizing the **sum of squared errors (SSE)** the total difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "- The model finds the best-fit line that **minimizes the prediction error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- Assumes linearity; struggles with complex non-linear relationships.\n",
    "- Sensitive to outliers and multicollinearity.\n",
    "- Requires careful validation of assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Violations of Assumptions\n",
    "- **Non-linearity**: Add polynomial/interaction terms.\n",
    "- **Heteroscedasticity**: Use weighted least squares or transform Y.\n",
    "- **Non-normality**: Transform Y (e.g., log transformation).\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity**: Remove correlated variables or use regularization (Ridge/Lasso).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization Techniques\n",
    "- Ridge Regression (L2): Shrinks coefficients but does not eliminate them.\n",
    "- Lasso Regression (L1): Performs feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero.\n",

    "Polynomial features extend linear regression by adding terms that are powers or interactions of the original features, allowing the model to fit non-linear patterns. While basic linear regression assumes a straight-line relationship (\\(y = w_0 + w_1x\\)), polynomial regression introduces higher-degree terms (e.g., \\(x^2, x^3\\)) and interactions (e.g., \\(x_1x_2\\)) to model curves and complex dependencies.\n",

    "### Example\n",
    "If we have a dataset with one input feature \\( X \\), we can create a new feature by squaring \\( X \\), i.e., \\( X^2 \\). This process can be extended for higher-degree polynomials:\n",
