    "# 🎯 ML: Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a supervised learning technique used to solve classification problems. It predicts a categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its name, it is not a regression algorithm but a classification technique that models the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What is Logistic Regression?**\n",
    "- Logistic regression is a statistical method used for classification, despite its name suggesting regression. \n",
    "- It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class, making it ideal for binary outcomes (e.g., spam vs. not spam) and extendable to multiclass problems. \n",
    "- It models assumes the relationship (linear) between features and the log-odds of the probability of the outcome using the logistic (**sigmoid**) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why Use Logistic Regression?**\n",
    "- **Probability Output**: Predicts probabilities, not just class labels.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Coefficients reveal feature importance.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Works well with linearly separable data and small-to-medium datasets.\n",
    "- **Foundation**: Basis for understanding more complex models (e.g., neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Mathematical Formulation**\n",
    "For binary classification:\n",
    "1. **Linear Combination**: \\( z = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\cdots + w_nx_n \\), where \\(w_i\\) are weights and \\(x_i\\) are features.\n",
    "2. **Sigmoid Function**\n",
    "3. **Decision Rule**: Predict class 1 if \\(P(y=1|X) > 0.5\\), else class 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic (Sigmoid) Function\n",
    "- **Formula**: `P(y=1|X) = σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))`  \n",
    "- The logistic (sigmoid) function maps any real value to a range between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- The output probability helps determine whether the predicted class is 0 or 1 using a threshold value.\n",
    "- **Threshold Concept**:\n",
    "  - **If output ≥ 0.5**, classify as **1** (Will buy insurance).\n",
    "  - **If output < 0.5**, classify as **0** (Will not buy insurance).\n",

    "## Logistic Regression for Binary Classification\n",
    "- **Model**: Logistic regression uses the **sigmoid function** to model the probability that an input belongs to the positive class (e.g., class 1):\n",
    "  ```math\n",
    "     P(y=1 | x) = 1 /(1 + e^-(w^T x + b))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Here, \\(w\\) is the weight vector, \\(x\\) is the input feature vector, and \\(b\\) is the bias term. The output is a value between 0 and 1, interpreted as a probability.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions of Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Relationship**: There is a linear relationship between the log-odds of the dependent variable and the independent variables, use polynomial features for non-linearity.\n",
    "3. **Independence of Observations**: Each observation is independent of the others.\n",
    "4. **No Multicollinearity**: The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "5. **Large Sample Size**: Logistic Regression performs better with larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistic Regression for Multiclass\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiclass logistic regression generalizes binary logistic regression to classify data into three or more categories (e.g., classifying flowers into setosa, versicolor, or virginica). It predicts the probability of each class and assigns the instance to the class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use It?**\n",
    "- **Probability Estimates**: Provides probabilities for all classes.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Extends linear methods to multiclass without needing complex models.\n",
    "- **Foundation**: Underpins neural networks and softmax layers in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approaches**\n",
    "1. **One-vs-Rest (OvR) / One-vs-All (OvA)**: Trains a separate binary classifier for each class against all others.\n",
    "2. **Softmax Regression (Multinomial)**: Models all classes jointly using the softmax function, optimizing a single loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Concepts and Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. One-vs-Rest (OvR)**\n",
    "The **One-vs-Rest** (also called One-vs-All) method breaks down a multiclass problem into multiple binary classification tasks.\n",
    "- **How It Works**:\n",
    "  - For \\(k\\) classes, train \\(k\\) separate binary logistic regression models.\n",
    "  - Each model distinguishes one class (positive) from all other classes combined (negative).\n",
    "  - Example: For three classes (A, B, C):\n",
    "    1. Model 1: A vs. (B + C)\n",
    "    2. Model 2: B vs. (A + C)\n",
    "    3. Model 3: C vs. (A + B)\n",
    "- **Prediction**: Choose the class with the highest probability across all classifiers.\n",
    "- **Loss**: Binary cross-entropy for each classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Multinomial Logistic Regression (Softmax Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Multinomial** or **Softmax** approach models all classes simultaneously using a single model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How It Works**:\n",
    "- Instead of the sigmoid function, it uses the **softmax function** to compute probabilities across all \\(k\\) classes.\n",
    "  - For an input \\(x\\) and class \\(j\\), the probability is:\n",
    "    ```math\n",
    "    P(y=j | x) = \\frac{e^{w_j^T x + b_j}}{\\sum_{m=1}^{k} e^{w_m^T x + b_m}}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- \\(w_j\\) and \\(b_j\\) are the weight vector and bias for class \\(j\\).\n",
    "- The denominator normalizes the probabilities so they sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prediction**:\n",
    "  - The predicted class is the one with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training**:\n",
    "  - The model optimizes a single set of weights and biases for all classes by minimizing the **cross-entropy loss** (a generalization of binary cross-entropy).\n",

    "- **Regularization**:\n",
    "  - Controlled by the `C` parameter (inverse of regularization strength). Smaller `C` means stronger regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Splitting the Data**:\n",
    "   - The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing sets using `train_test_split`.\n",

    "   - A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data with `LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)` to ensure convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Making Predictions**:\n",
    "   - The model predicts the labels for the test set using `model.predict()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluating the Model**:\n",
    "   - **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions.\n",
    "   - **Precision**: The proportion of true positives among predicted positives.\n",
    "   - **Recall**: The proportion of true positives among actual positives.\n",
    "   - **Confusion Matrix**: A table showing true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading Data**:\n",
    "   - The Iris dataset is loaded using `load_iris()`. Features are stored in `X` (150x4), and labels in `y` (150,).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - **Splitting**: 80% training, 20% testing.\n",
    "   - **Scaling**: `StandardScaler` standardizes features to have zero mean and unit variance, improving model convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training**:\n",
    "   - The `LogisticRegression` model uses `multi_class='multinomial'` for the Softmax approach and `solver='lbfgs'` for optimization.\n",
    "   - `C=1.0` controls regularization strength (can be tuned via cross-validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.\n",
    "   - **Confusion Matrix**: Shows true vs. predicted labels for each class.\n",
    "   - **Log Loss**: Measures the quality of probability predictions (lower is better).\n",
    "   - **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV provides a robust performance estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Uses petal length and width (features 2 and 3) to plot decision boundaries in 2D.\n",
    "   - The `contourf` plot shows decision regions, and `scatter` overlays training points.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Coefficients**:\n",
    "   - `model.coef_` (3x4 matrix) shows the weight of each feature for each class.\n",
    "   - `model.intercept_` (array of length 3) gives the bias for each class.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Additional Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Feature Scaling\n",
    "- Scaling is crucial when features have different ranges (e.g., sepal length vs. petal width). Without scaling, features with larger ranges might dominate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Regularization Tuning\n",
    "- Use `GridSearchCV` to tune `C`:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n",
    "  param_grid = {'C': [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]}\n",
    "  grid = GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression(multi_class='multinomial', solver='lbfgs'), param_grid, cv=5)\n",
    "  grid.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\n",
    "  print(f\"Best C: {grid.best_params_['C']}\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Alternative Libraries\n",
    "- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For custom implementations or integration with neural networks.\n",
    "  - Example: Define a softmax layer with categorical cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "- Scikit-learn is preferred for simplicity and standard tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Decision Boundaries\n",
    "- Logistic regression produces **linear decision boundaries**. For non-linear problems, consider kernel methods or other classifiers (e.g., SVM, neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **4. Tools and Methods Summary**\n",
    "- **Modeling**: `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`.\n",
    "- **Manual**: `numpy` for sigmoid, gradient descent.\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: `sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score`, `log_loss`, `confusion_matrix`.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: `matplotlib.pyplot.contourf()`, `seaborn.scatterplot()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "Logistic regression is a versatile, interpretable algorithm for classification, bridging linear models and probabilistic outputs via the sigmoid function.\n",
